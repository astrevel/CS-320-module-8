# CS-320 Module 8

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?  
To ensure functionality, I would suggest that consistently testing your code with unit, integration, and system tests throughout development is the way to go. For security, following best practices like input validation, secure coding standards, and regularly updating dependencies will mitigate the risk of any kind of security risks. I also believe conducting thorough code reviews and using static analysis tools to detect vulnerabilities early helps as well. Additionally, implementing automated security testing as part of your CI/CD pipeline are all ways to ensure that your code is functional and secure.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How I start interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program is by gathering detailed user requirements through surveys, interviews, or user stories. I feel understanding the core problems that users are faced with, can help prioritize features that address their needs. Additionally, continuously engaging with users through feedback loops, and iterating on the design and functionality of your program can help ensure it aligns with their expectations.

### How do I approach designing software?
The way that I now approach designing software begins with determining clear requirements and creating a high-level design that outlines the system architecture. Breaking down the design into smaller, manageable components, ensuring modularity along with scalability. I try to review my code often to ensure that I am writing clean code, and now I write unit tests often and ensure that any dependencies that I have used in my project are up to date. This ensures that the feature that Iâ€™m working on, behaves as intended, and also helps lower the risk of security vulnerabilities. Overall, I would say prioritizing user experience, and ensuring your design is adaptable to future changes or enhancements, is important, when it comes to designing software.
